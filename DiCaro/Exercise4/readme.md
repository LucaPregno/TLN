# Text Tiling (Exercise 4)

## Requirement
Inspired by Text Tiling, implement an algorithm of text segmentation.
It is possibile to use any information preferred like frequency, lexical resources etc.
Which texts is your choice.
    
## Intro
Text tiling algorithms try to group sentences about the same topic. 
The general idea is to find through different characteristics (e.g. frequency or lexical resources)
